Overview
--------

The `Activity` module provides methods for interacting with logs generated by the DOLOST application. It includes functionality to review logs from the activity viewer.

Reviewing Logs
----------------

The `ActivityViewer` class includes a static method `review_logs` that allows users to retrieve and review the latest log entries from the activity viewer.

.. code-block:: python

    from DOLOST.services.activity import ActivityViewer

    # Retrieve the latest log entries from the activity viewer
    logs = ActivityViewer.review_logs()

    # Print the retrieved log entries
    for log_entry in logs:
        print(log_entry)

This method connects to the DolosT-Collector container, which serves as the centralized log collector for all decoys. It then tails the last 50 lines of each log file within the `/var/log/decoys/` folder, continuously monitoring for new log entries.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~

- `container_id` (str): The ID of the DolosT-Collector container.
- `folder_path` (str): The path to the folder containing log files (`/var/log/decoys/` by default).

Returns
~~~~~~~~

- `list`: A list containing the latest log entries from the activity viewer.
