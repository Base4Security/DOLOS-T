WebSocket
=================

The WebSocket module in DOLOST provides functionality for handling WebSocket connections and communication with clients.

WebSocket endpoints enable real-time bidirectional communication between the DOLOST server and connected clients. These endpoints are used to transmit updates, statistics, and other real-time data to clients without the need for continuous polling.
